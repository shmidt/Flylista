Flylista
========
Flylista is a flights schedules for norwegian airports,
based on [Flight data Avinor](http://www.avinor.no/avinor/trafikk/50_Flydata).

It's main differense from altenative app that you can set a reminder(notification) right from the app(many times I picked some friends from the airport, so this feature comes from those times) 

It's my second app, so it's messy :)

App at [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/flylista/id486934512?mt=8)
