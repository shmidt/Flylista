Flylista
========
Flylista is a flights schedules for norwegian airports,
based on [Flights data from Avinor](http://www.avinor.no/avinor/trafikk/50_Flydata).

The main differense from other apps is that you can set a reminder(notification) right from the app(many times I picked friends from the airport, so this feature comes from those times) 

It's my second app, so it's messy :)

Licensed under MIT license(it means you can do whatever you want).
3rd party code used in app goes under it's licenses.
